## Usage

You can edit the configuration of every file in the file itself.
After you've made your changes/configuration, just run the file and wait for the output to say that it finished.

You can start a script via console like this:

```bash
python get_team_data_new.py
```

You should configure it before running.

There is a config dictionary in every file.
You can change stuff like file to read, savefile, amount and so on.
Every option is commented so you know what it does.
